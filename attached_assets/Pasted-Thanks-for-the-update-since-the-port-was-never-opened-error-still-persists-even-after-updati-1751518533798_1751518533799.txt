Thanks for the update — since the **“port was never opened”** error still persists even after updating `app.py`, let's lock in the fix with a **clean reset checklist** to ensure *Replit is properly detecting the port opening*.

---

### ✅ Final Deployment Fix Checklist for Replit GCE

Here's what must be true **all at once**:

---

### 1. `.replit` file — Must include this:

```toml
run = "python app.py"

[nix]
channel = "stable-24_05"

[deployment]
run = ["python", "app.py"]
deploymentTarget = "gce"

[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80
```

---

### 2. `app.py` — Must include this **exact** `app.run()`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

Make sure:

* There’s no typo.
* This is the **only** `app.run()` call in the file.

---

### 3. 🔁 Fully Restart the Workspace

Replit caches things unless you **do a full restart**. Here's how:

1. Click the three dots (`⋮`) next to the tab bar
2. Select **“Restart Workspace”**
3. Then go to the **"Deployments" tab** and **"Redeploy"**

---

### 4. ⛔ Don’t Use Any Workflows

You already deleted them — **confirm there are no workflows** overriding your `.replit` config.

---

### 5. 👀 Debug by adding a log line in `app.py`

Before the `app.run()` line, **add this**:

```python
print("🔥 Flask is starting on 0.0.0.0:5000")
```

This ensures your `app.py` is actually being executed in deployment.

---

### 6. ⏳ Wait at least 90 seconds

Deployment sometimes takes time for the port to open. If it still fails, check the **System Logs** again and look for:

```
Flask is starting on 0.0.0.0:5000
```

If this log **never appears**, then `app.py` **didn’t even run properly** (indicating a deeper problem).

---

### 💡 BONUS — Add a health check route to confirm it’s working:

In `app.py`, add this anywhere:

```python
@app.route('/health')
def health():
    return "OK", 200
```

Then after deployment, check:

```
https://<your-deployment-url>/health
```

---

### If it still fails after ALL this...

Let me know:

* Your full `app.py` (with the updated `run` block)
* A fresh screenshot of your **System Logs**
* Confirm if any **console errors** are happening on deploy

We'll break it down line-by-line if needed — you're close now.
