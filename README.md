# 🧠 AI Detector

Detects AI-generated images, texts, and videos using open-source models.

## 🚀 Overview

**AI Detector** is a lightweight, web-based tool that allows users to upload content (images, text, or videos) and receive instant feedback on whether the content is likely AI-generated. It leverages top-performing open-source models across various modalities to ensure accurate detection — all through a simple interface.

This tool is intended to help content platforms, researchers, journalists, and curious users identify synthetic media.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🖼️ **Image Detection** – Identify if a photo was generated by models like Midjourney, DALL·E, or Stable Diffusion.
- 📝 **Text Detection** – Flag AI-written text from tools like ChatGPT or Claude.
- 🎥 **Video Detection** – (Planned) Analyze short video clips to detect deepfakes or synthetic frames.
- 🌐 **Web UI** – Clean interface built for uploading and analyzing files.
- 🧪 **Open-Source Models** – Integrates the best public AI detection models.

## 📦 MVP Tech Stack

- Python + FastAPI (backend)
- OpenCV + PIL (image preprocessing)
- Transformers / PyTorch (model integration)
- Replit for hosting
- GitHub for version control
